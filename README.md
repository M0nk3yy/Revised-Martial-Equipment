# Revised Martial Equipment

RME is a comprehensive overhaul of weaponry and martial techniques for D&D 5e by Commander Fayne. It aims to make martial classes more powerful, varied, and interesting. It rewrites feats, completely changes the balance of all weapons, and adds numerous new weapons and actions. It is **strongly** advised that you read Commander Faynes full homebrew before attempting to use it in your campaign!

Whilst I have done my best to translate this homebrew to Foundry VTT, many of it's elements do not play well in a VTT environment. If you have any feedback on potential improvements, or you spot any errors/bugs, please log an issue here on github.

You can find me on the Foundry VTT official Discord (Monkeyy#1250 https://discord.gg/foundryvtt)

Disclaimer: The alterations included in RME make martial characters **considerably** more powerful. Do not be surprised when they excel in combat, tear through standard encounters, and perhaps even outshine magic users! Considering magic users can literally bend reality at high levels, this should be seen as a fair trade.
